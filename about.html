        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Ankitha V. I started my career as an Associate Software Engineer in August 2022 and worked until
            March 2024. During that time, I got hands-on experience in software development, mainly working with Java
            and tools like GitLab and Jira.

        </p>

        <p>
            But honestly, I’ve always been more interested in DevOps and cloud technologies. So, when I took a break
            from my job due to personal reasons, I decided to make the most of that time and focus on what I truly
            enjoy.

        </p>

        <p>
            Since then, I’ve been learning DevOps tools and working on hands-on projects — like containerizing
            applications using Docker, deploying them on Kubernetes, writing Dockerfiles, building Jenkins pipelines,
            and creating infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.

        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I’m looking for opportunities in DevOps or Cloud Engineering where I can apply everything I’ve learned,
            grow even more, and be part of exciting projects.
