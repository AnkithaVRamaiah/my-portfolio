        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Ankitha V</strong>.</p>

        <p>
            I started my career in August 2022 as an Associate Software Engineer, mainly working on Java-based
            applications.
            I was involved in the full development cycle — writing code, fixing bugs, and collaborating with teams using
            tools like GitLab and Jira.
            While I enjoyed backend development, I found myself increasingly curious about what happens after the code
            is written — how it’s built, tested, deployed, and managed.
        </p>

        <p>That curiosity led me to DevOps.</p>

        <p>
            Even during my developer role, I got a chance to work closely with the DevOps team — writing and reviewing
            Dockerfiles, contributing to Jenkins pipelines, and helping with deployments to dev and QA environments.
            I wasn’t officially in a DevOps role, but I knew it was something I wanted to explore further.
        </p>

        <p>
            In March 2024, I stepped away from my job for personal reasons. Since then, I’ve fully focused on building
            my DevOps skills.
            I’ve spent my time learning through real hands-on projects — not just tutorials. I’ve worked on:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Containerizing applications using Docker</li>
            <li>Creating CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions</li>
            <li>Deploying apps to Kubernetes clusters (Minikube & EKS)</li>
            <li>Managing Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments</li>
            <li>Writing Terraform scripts to automate AWS infrastructure</li>
            <li>Using Ansible for configuration management</li>
            <li>Practicing monitoring with CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Now, I’m actively looking for DevOps or Cloud Engineering opportunities where I can apply what I’ve learned,
            contribute to real-world projects, and keep growing in a collaborative team.
        </p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to get to know me!</p>
