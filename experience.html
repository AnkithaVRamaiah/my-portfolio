        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Associate Software Engineer – CGI | August 2022 – March 2024</strong></li>

            <li>I began my career at CGI as an Associate Software Engineer, primarily working on Java-based
                microservices and backend development.</li>

            <li>I used GitLab for version control and Jira for tracking project tasks and sprint planning as part of an
                Agile team.</li>

            <li>As part of the development process, I worked closely with the DevOps team to write Dockerfiles for
                containerizing our Java applications and helped integrate them into Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines for
                Dev and QA environments.</li>

            <li>I regularly collaborated with cross-functional teams to support smoother deployments, improve
                automation, and troubleshoot build-related issues during releases.</li>

            <li>I also generated internal reports for the development team, including data extraction and formatting
                (initially using Power BI).</li>

            <li>This role gave me a strong foundation in backend development, version control, Agile collaboration, and
                practical exposure to DevOps tools and workflows — which later inspired my transition into DevOps
                engineering.</li>
